# Troubleshooting & FAQ

## Common Issues

- **SDK not initializing?** → Check if config keys are assigned.
- **IL2CPP build errors?** → Ensure link.xml file is present.
- **No logs in Unity console?** → Enable GRLogger.IsLoggingEnabled = true.
- **IAP not available?** → Verify StoreKit (iOS) / Google Play (Android) setup.
