# Quick Start

Get started with GameRamp SDK in just 3 steps. Choose between automatic setup with our prefab or manual configuration.

## Step 1: Import the SDK

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Package">
    Download the GameRamp SDK package (.unitypackage) from your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import in Unity">
    In Unity: **Assets → Import Package → Custom Package**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select and Import">
    Select the downloaded package and import all files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Confirm the `GamerampSDK/` folder is present in your project
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
After importing, you should see the `GamerampSDK/` folder in your Project window with all SDK files.
</Check>

## Step 2: Create Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Config Asset">
    In the Project window: **Create → Gameramp → SDKConfig**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Config">
    Name it `GamerampConfig` (or any preferred name)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credentials">
    Fill in your credentials in the Inspector:
    - **SDK Key** (required)
    - **Secret Key** (required)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Keep your Secret Key secure and never commit it to public repositories.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Initialize SDK

Choose one of the following initialization methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1: Prefab (Recommended)">
    The easiest way to get started - perfect for most use cases.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Prefab to Scene">
        Drag `Gameramp.prefab` from `GamerampSDK/Prefabs/` into your first scene
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign Configuration">
        Select the prefab and assign your `GamerampConfig` to the config field in the Inspector
      </Step>
      <Step title="Automatic Initialization">
        The prefab will automatically:
        - Initialize the SDK on Start
        - Handle authentication
        - Persist across scenes (DontDestroyOnLoad)
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
    The prefab handles all initialization automatically. No additional code required!
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Option 2: Manual Setup">
    For custom initialization flow or advanced use cases.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create GameObject">
        Create an empty GameObject in your scene
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Component">
        Add the `GamerampSDK.cs` component to the GameObject
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign Configuration">
        Assign your `GamerampConfig` to the component's config field
      </Step>
      <Step title="Initialize in Code">
        Call initialization methods before using any SDK features:

        ```csharp
        // 1. Initialize the SDK
        Gameramp.Initialize(config);

        // 2. Login the user
        Gameramp.Login(
            onSuccess: () => Debug.Log("Login successful!"),
            onFail: () => Debug.LogError("Login failed!")
        );
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
    With manual setup, ensure you call `Initialize()` and `Login()` before using any other SDK features.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verification

After initialization, verify the SDK is working:

<CodeGroup>
```csharp Unity Console
// You should see this in the Unity Console
"GameRamp SDK Initialized Successfully"
"Login successful!"
```

```csharp Test Code
// Test the SDK is working
void Start() {
    // Track a test event
    Gameramp.TrackSessionStart();
    Debug.Log("GameRamp SDK is working!");
}
```
</CodeGroup>
