# Setup & Configuration

Configure platform-specific settings for Android, iOS, and IL2CPP builds.

## Android

- Enable custom mainTemplate.gradle in Player Settings.
- Java version: VERSION_11 (Unity 2021.3.45) & VERSION_17 (Unity 6)
- Permissions automatically added: INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE

## iOS

- Target minimum iOS 12.0.
- StoreKit automatically included for IAP.

## IL2CPP

Unity's IL2CPP backend strips unused code during builds. To prevent GameRamp SDK classes and Newtonsoft.Json types from being removed, a link.xml file is required.

- A preconfigured link.xml file is already included with the GameRamp SDK package (GamerampSDK/link.xml).
- If your project already has a link.xml file:
  - Open it and check whether it contains entries for:
    - GamerampCoreDLL / GamerampUnitySDK
    - Newtonsoft.Json
  - If these entries are missing, copy them from the provided file and add them into your existing link.xml.
- If your project does not have a link.xml:
  - Move or copy the provided file into your project's Assets/ root directory.

**Note:** Unity only respects link.xml files inside the Assets/ directory. Files left inside the SDK package folder will be ignored during build.
